/**
 * A short exclusive lease on one key - `SyncCommand` holds one per (mailbox, device, folder) for the duration of a
 * collection's round, so two concurrent `Sync`s of the same collection (a client retrying while its first request is
 * still running, or two server copies) can't both read the same state, apply their commands and overwrite each
 * other's result.
 *
 * Always taken in-process first (a per-key promise chain), then - when a Redis URL is configured - as a `SET NX PX`
 * key shared by every server copy, released with a token check and renewed (token-checked `PEXPIRE`) every
 * `ttlMs / 3` while held, so a round that outlasts `ttlMs` doesn't lose it to another copy.
 *
 * **Redis being unreachable fails open** to the in-process lease alone rather than refusing - or hanging - every
 * `Sync`: the client is created with `disableOfflineQueue` (a command fails at once while disconnected instead of
 * waiting in a queue) and a bounded `reconnectStrategy` (so `connect()` rejects instead of retrying forever), and
 * every connect/`SET` is additionally raced against `redisTimeoutMs`. The connect and the first `SET` get the whole
 * `redisTimeoutMs` even when the in-process wait already used up `waitMs` - otherwise a healthy Redis would get no time
 * at all and the lease would fail open for nothing; only the polling `SET`s after Redis has answered are cut short by
 * the deadline, which then means another copy still holds the key (`undefined`). A `SET` that times out but lands later
 * is released again straight away. A client whose reconnects gave up is replaced on the next lease.
 *
 * **Release never hangs**: the token-checked release is raced against `redisTimeoutMs` too (the key expires on its
 * own), and the in-process lease is freed whatever happens to it.
